Using this code, you will be able to create a chatbot that utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions about Cisco’s Smart Bonding Partner API, pulling information from publicly available documentation. After completing this tutorial, you should be able to easily adapt it, so the chatbot responds questions about your company or products.

This chatbot is a proof of concept (PoC) to evaluate the feasibility of using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based on publicly available DevNet documentation for Cisco APIs.
